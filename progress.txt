# Ralph Progress Log
## Codebase Patterns
- Frontend dashboard stories in this PRD are implemented under `ui/raw-data-dashboard`; run dependency installs and quality checks from that directory.
- Keep dashboard theming centralized in `ui/raw-data-dashboard/src/styles.css` `:root` tokens and reference variables instead of hardcoded colors.

- Implemented the design-system foundation for the dashboard: imported JetBrains Mono in `index.html`, rewrote `styles.css` with dark-mode CSS variables, and added base `.card`, `.pill`, and animated `.skeleton` styles.
- Files changed: `ui/raw-data-dashboard/*` (added dashboard app baseline), `ui/raw-data-dashboard/index.html`, `ui/raw-data-dashboard/src/styles.css`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The dashboard is a standalone Vite app; run `npm ci` once in `ui/raw-data-dashboard` before running `npm run build`.
  - The core color/typography system now lives in `ui/raw-data-dashboard/src/styles.css` `:root`; new UI work should consume these tokens for consistent dark-mode styling.
  - Browser automation/dev-browser tooling was not available in this environment, so manual browser verification is required.
